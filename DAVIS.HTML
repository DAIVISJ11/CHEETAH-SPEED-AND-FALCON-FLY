THIS IS HOW I START A AFTER CLASS PROJECT IN 
VS CODE IT IS A  AMAZING WAY TO MAKE A AFTER CLASS
PROJECT I LOVE IT SO MUCH.I AM DAVIS A YOUNG 
PROGGRAMER WHO LEARNT TO CODING FROM A COMPANY CALLED
CODINGAL I HAVE OVER 200 BADGES IN CODINGAL
I LOVE CODING SO MUCH NOW THAT WE STOPPED BLOCK BASED CODING
WE STARTED TO LEARN ABOUT TEXT BASED CODING IT IS A LOT HARDER THAN 
THE SIMPLE BLOCK BASED CODING I AM OPEN TO LEARNING 
SO I AM ENJOYING IT.I LOVE CODING SO MUCH IT IS BETTER THAN
LEARNNG IN SCHOOL. IT IS AMAZING. I AM AMAZING.
THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS TO MAKE A CODE .I WOULD RECOMEND
YOU START WITH BLOCK BASED CODING THEN PROCEED
TO TEXT BASED CODING.PLEASE DON`T BECOME A HACKER
OR YOU WILL GET ARRESTED.
